## Unspecified Event Detection Datasets
This dataset is a substantial collection of Persian-language tweets harvested from Twitter using the SNScrape tool. It comprises a total of 763,000 tweets gathered over the period from 20 February 2023 to 20 March 2023. Notably, during the data collection process, no specific limitations or content restrictions were applied, resulting in a diverse and comprehensive set of tweets.

### Dataset Purpose:
The primary objective of this dataset is to serve as an evaluation benchmark for the EnrichEvent Framework, a novel framework developed as part of a master's thesis. The framework's purpose is to address the challenging problem of unspecified event detection, which involves identifying and categorizing events without access to any metadata or prior information about the events mentioned in the tweets.

### Dataset Details:
* **Data Source**: Twitter
* **Data Collection Method**: SNScrape
* **Language**: Persian
* **Total Samples**: 763,000
* **Collection Period**: 20 February 2023 to 20 March 2023

### Data Characteristics:
The dataset contains raw, unprocessed tweets as they were originally posted on Twitter. No content selection or preprocessing has been applied, preserving the authenticity of the tweets.

### Potential Use Cases:
This versatile dataset can be applied to a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including but not limited to:

* **Unspecified Event Detection**: Evaluating models and algorithms designed to identify and categorize unspecified events from unstructured text data.
* **Unsupervised Opinion Summarization**: Extracting and summarizing public opinions and sentiments from the tweets without prior event metadata.
* **User Behavior Analysis**: Analyzing user behavior and trends based on their interactions and discussions on Twitter during the specified time frame.
* **Topic Modeling**: Identifying prevalent topics and trends within the Persian Twitter community during the data collection period.

### Data Usage and Preprocessing:
It's important to note that no preprocessing has been applied to this dataset. Users are encouraged to preprocess and format the data according to their specific research needs and project requirements. you can donwload the dataset from my google drive via [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RrrKUDdJDwJ1PrPxDdgcEtMghUY51nzJ/view?usp=sharing).

## Trend Detection Datasets

This dataset is a comprehensive collection of Persian-language tweets obtained from Twitter using the SNScrape tool. It comprises 1,633,632 samples categorized into 12 distinct categories. Each tweet in this dataset has been labeled using key phrases to facilitate the training of a supervised trend detection model. The primary objective of this dataset is to implement a model which calculate the probability of tweets referring to specific events or trends.

### Dataset Details:

* **Data Source**: Twitter
* **Data Collection Method**: SNScrape
* **Language**: Persian
* **Total Samples**: 1,633,632
* **Collection Time Period**: 23 February 2007 to 2 September 2022

### Categories:
The dataset is organized into 12 different categories, making it suitable for a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The categories include:

1. Sport
2. Technology
3. Crypto
4. Art
5. Economics
6. Politics
7. Celebrities
8. Environment
9. Industry
10. Video Games
11. Social
12. Health

## Labeling Method:
The tweets in this dataset have been thoughtfully labeled using key phrases. These labels are instrumental in training a supervised trend detection model. The primary objective of this model is to calculate the probability that a given tweet is referring to an event.

## Preprocessing Steps:
Before being made available, the dataset underwent comprehensive preprocessing to enhance its quality and usability. The following preprocessing steps were applied:

1. Removal of spam links from tweets.
2. Data type normalization for each column.
3. Removal of mentioned users to protect privacy.
4. Normalization of the tweets for consistency.
5. Conversion of emojis to their text representations to maintain textual integrity.

### Potential Use Cases:
This dataset can be applied to a variety of NLP tasks, including but not limited to:

* **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzing the sentiment of tweets within each category or for specific events.
* **Social Media Analysis:** Gaining insights into trends, topics, and discussions on social media platforms.
* **Opinion Summarization:** Summarizing opinions and perspectives expressed in tweets within different categories.
* **Trend Detection:** Categorizing tweets based on the specific event or trend they reference.
